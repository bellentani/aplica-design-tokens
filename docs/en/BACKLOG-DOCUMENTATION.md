## üìä **Prioritization by Impact vs Effort**

### **High Impact + Low Effort**
1. **Troubleshooting & FAQ** - Resolves 80% of common questions
2. **Performance benchmarks** - Add to existing Technical Reference

### **High Impact + High Effort**  
1. **Migration Guide** - Critical for adoption, but extensive
2. **API Documentation** - Necessary for API-based brands

### **Medium Impact + Low Effort**
1. **CLI Commands Reference** - Improve existing files
2. **Debugging sections** - Add to current files

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Suggested Implementation**

### **Phase 1** (Next 2 weeks)
- Create **Troubleshooting & FAQ** (#06)
- Improve **Implementation Guide** with debugging
- Add performance section to **Technical Reference**

### **Phase 2** (Next month)  
- Create **Migration Guide** (#07)
- Document **API** (#09)
- Improve **Executive Summary** with comparisons

### **Phase 3** (As needed)
- **Performance & Monitoring** (#08)
- **Advanced Techniques** (#10)
- **Case Studies** (#12)

---

## üí° **Important Observations**

### **Excellent Current Quality**
Existing documentation is **very well structured** and covers:
- ‚úÖ Complete architecture and concepts
- ‚úÖ Practical step-by-step implementation  
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive technical reference
- ‚úÖ Clear executive vision

### **Gaps are Support-related, not Conceptual**
Missing files are mainly for:
- **Operation** (troubleshooting, performance)
- **Adoption** (migration, onboarding)
- **Scale** (monitoring, advanced techniques)

### **Priority: Troubleshooting First**
The most critical file is **Troubleshooting & FAQ** as it resolves the main barriers to adoption and usage.

## üîÑ **Update Process**

### **When to Create New Files**
- When we identify patterns of recurring questions
- When we start real migrations of legacy systems  
- When we scale to 10+ brands

### **How to Keep Updated**
- Quarterly review of files
- Feedback from real users
- Usage metrics and friction points

### **Ownership**
- **Concepts/Architecture**: Design Systems Team
- **Implementation/Code**: Engineering Team  
- **Troubleshooting/FAQ**: Support Team + Community feedback
